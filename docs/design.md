## Handling App Entry Points

### Hybrid Approach

#### Entities

- **User:** Represents the person accessing the system.
- **Employee:** Represents the role within an organization.
- **Organization:** Represents the company or department.

#### Relationships

- **User** has a one-to-many relationship with **Employee**.
- **Employee** has a many-to-one relationship with **Organization**.

#### Login Process

1. **User Registration:**

   - Create a `User` record.
   - Create an `Organization` and an `Employee` record for the user, linking the `Employee` to the `Organization`.

2. **User Login:**

   - Authenticate the user.
   - Fetch all `Employee` records associated with the user.
   - Display a list of organizations the user is associated with.
   - Upon selecting an organization, set the current context to the chosen organization and employee.

3. **Organization Switching:**
   - Provide an option to switch organizations within the app.
   - Allow users to switch context without logging out by fetching the relevant `Employee` and `Organization` records.

#### Benefits

- **Flexibility:** Users can easily switch between organizations without logging out.
- **Simplicity:** Simplified data model compared to having fully separate entities.
- **User Experience:** Improved user experience with a straightforward way to switch contexts.
